# Web Scraping with Python and Beautiful Soup

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to perform web scraping using Python with the Beautiful Soup library. Web scraping involves extracting data from websites, which can be useful for various applications such as data analysis, content aggregation, and more.

## Features

- Scrape data from websites using Beautiful Soup.
- Handle and parse HTML content.
- Save scraped data to a CSV file.
- Include error handling and logging for robust scraping.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Web-Scraping-with-Python---Beautiful-Soup.git
   cd Web-Scraping-with-Python---Beautiful-Soup
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the `scraper.py` file and modify the `URL` variable to the website you want to scrape.

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python scraper.py
   ```

3. The scraped data will be saved to `output.csv` in the project directory.

## Example

Here's a basic example of how to use Beautiful Soup to scrape a webpage:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import csv

# URL of the webpage to scrape
URL = 'https://example.com'

# Send a GET request to the webpage
response = requests.get(URL)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

# Extract data from the webpage
data = []
for item in soup.find_all('tag'):  # Replace 'tag' with the actual HTML tag
    data.append({
        'field': item.get_text()  # Replace 'field' with the actual field name
    })

# Save data to CSV
with open('output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=['field'])
    writer.writeheader()
    writer.writerows(data)
```
