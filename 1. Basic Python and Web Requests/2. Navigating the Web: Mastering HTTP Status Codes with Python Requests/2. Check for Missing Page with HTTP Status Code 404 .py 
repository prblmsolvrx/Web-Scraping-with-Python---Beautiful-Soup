"""
In this exercise, you will tweak our HTTP status check for the online bookstore's quotes page.
Instead of confirming that the page is up with a 200 OK, change the code to check if the page
cannot be found, using a 404 Not Found status code. Let's ensure our code can handle different
types of HTTP responses effectively!
